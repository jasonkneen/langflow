2. **Visual IDE** for drag-and-drop building and testing of workflows
3. **Playground** to immediately test and iterate workflows
4. **Multi-agent** orchestration and conversation management
5. **Flexible Architecture** supporting classes, functions, and ES6 modules
6. **MCP Server Integration** for advanced AI capabilities
7. **Modern Stack** built with React/TypeScript frontend
8. **RESTful API** for seamless frontend-backend communication
9. **Extensible Design** for custom node implementations
10. **Developer-First** approach with clear separation of concerns
